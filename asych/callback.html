    <h3>call back function</h3>
    <ul>when a function recieves a function as a paramenter is called as call back function</ul>
    <li>MFR,(settimeout,setInterval)=>these are call back but we called as asychronous function </li>
    <li>sych always last in first out(FIFO)</li>
    <li>asych always first in last out(LIFO)</li>
    <li>javascript is a single thread component but we are converting to multi thread component 
        by using asychronous like setTimeout() 
        we only use setTime for static avoided for dynamic api function in some time we need wait get api even its loaded quickly 
        we should give min * 3 or greater waiting request time thats the disadvantages
    </li>
    <li>if you need to convert as JSON file the data must be in double quotesotherwise we
       cant able to convert as JSON </li>
